## Description

> Introduction of tool, including its input(s)/output(s) as well as a list (or link to) of available shell commands (useful when building interfaces/wrappers for containers)

> Table with embedded registry links, if suitable.

| Repository / Registry  |   Available? |
|:----------------------:|-------------|
|       bio.tools        | Add URL here |
|        bioconda        | Add URL here |
|     BioContainers      | Add URL here |



## Diagram

> Logical visual description of processing steps for tool, e.g. for pipelines shipped as packages (Falcon, Cellranger, ..)


## How to cite this software

> Add citation instructions here.


## User guide


### Install

> General installation guide.

> If there are different installation requirements for specific compute infrastructures you could indicate these here, or in an individual infrastructure documentation template: https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines/blob/master/infrastructure_optimisation.md


### Quick start guide

> General guide for deployment across multiple infrastructures (distinct from specific infrastructure quick start guide).


### Required (minimum) inputs / parameters

> The minimum inputs required for the workflow to run.


### Dependencies & third party tools 

> Add / list known dependencies, or link to a list of these dependencies.


### Recommendations for use on specific compute systems

> You could include:
> + a link to installation instructions for each computational infrastructure, if the requirements for each system are unique 
> + recommendations for use on a specific computational infrastructure or system

> Documentation for a specific infrastructure could also go into a infrastructure documentation template https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines/blob/master/infrastructure_optimisation.md


### Benchmarking (compute resource usage on tested infrastructures)

> Minimal information to include here:
> - Max threads
> - Peak ram used
> - Operating system compatibility

> Benchmarking for a specific infrastructure could also go here: if the benchmarking information is complicated it could go into a benchmarking template, or be provided elsewhere (e.g. Zenodo).

> Example table with high level compute resource usage information for standalone runs or testing of specific versions on specific computational infrastructures.
