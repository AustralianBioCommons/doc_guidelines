## Description

> Introduction of tool, including its input(s)/output(s) as well as a list (or link to) of available shell commands (useful when building interfaces/wrappers for containers)

> Table with embedded registry links, if suitable.

## How to cite this software


## User guide


### Install

> General installation guide.

> If there are different installation requirements based on infrastructures you could indicate these here, or in the individual infrastructure documentation template: https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines/blob/master/infrastructure_optimisation.md


### Quick start guide

> General guide for deployment across multiple infrastructures (distinct from specific infrastructure quick start guide).


### Required (minimum) inputs / parameters

> The minimum inputs required for the workflow to run.


### Third party tools / dependencies

> Add / list known dependencies, or link to a list of these dependencies.


### Infrastructure usage and recommendations

> You could include:
> + a link to installation instructions for each computational infrastructure 
> + recommendations for use on a specific computational infrastructure

> Documentation for a specific infrastructure should go into a infrastructure documentation template https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines/blob/master/infrastructure_optimisation.md


### Compute resource usage across tested infrastructures

> Table with high level compute resource usage information for standalone runs or testing of specific versions on specific computational infrastructures.

| Tool | Version | Sample description | Wall time | Cores | Peak RAM in GB (requested) | Drive (GB) | Compute system (e.g. Pawsey Setonix HPC, AWS) | Scheduler | Year-Month |
| ----- | ------- | ------------------ | --------- | ----- | -------------------------- | ---------- | ------- | --------- | ---------- |
|       |         |                    |           |       |                            |            |         |           |            |


### Benchmarking

> Benchmarking for a specific infrastructure should go here: if this document is complicated it should go into a benchmarking template, or be provided elsewhere (e.g. Zenodo).


## Additional notes

> Any comment on major features being introduced, or default/API changes that might result in unexpected behaviours.
