# Documentation guidelines change log


## v1.5

- Created `documentation_templates` directory
- Added more instructions to individual files (`CITATION.cff`, `licence` etc.)
- When using the guidelines as a template, the `README.md` should now be deleted when ready, and a replacement selected from the `documentation_templates` repository.
- Add example `codemeta.json`


## v1.4 (first official release)
Many thanks to @georgiesamaha and @tracychew from the Sydney Informatics Hub (University of Sydney) for the idea to add `*.cff` files to the guidelines.
- added both blank and documentation guideline `*.cff` files
- `tools.md` was updated to align with `workflows.md` structure from v1.3
     - biotools and EDAM references added
     - table of contents added
