# Infrastructure specific documentation & testing

## High level compute resource usage

```
Table with high level compute resource usage information for specific versions and infrastructures.
```

| Title |	Version | Sample description | Wall time | Cores | Peak RAM in GB (requested) |	Drive (GB) | HPC-HTC | If HPC-HTC is other, specify | Scheduler |	Year-Month |

## Infrastructure specific install, usage & optimisation

```
Instructions for a specific infrastructure should go into a infrastructure documentation template
https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines/blob/master/infrastructure_optimisation.md
```

# Benchmarking

```
Benchmarking for a specific infrastructure should go into a 30_benchmarking_[benchmarking-activity-name].md template. 

Currently in development!!!
