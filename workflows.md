## Infrastructure specific install, usage & optimisation

```
Instructions for a specific infrastructure should go into a infrastructure documentation template
https://github.com/AustralianBioCommons/doc_guidelines/blob/master/infrastructure_optimisation.md
```

# Benchmarking

```
Benchmarking for a specific infrastructure should go into a benchmarking template. 

Currently in development!!!
