# Australian BioCommons Documentation Guidelines

This repository contains a set of guidelines for bioinformatics tools and workflows. 

The initial version uploaded to GitHub was informed by current documentation practices and structures used in the GitHub community.

These guidelines will be further developed as needed to meet the requirements of the Australian BioCommons community.
